# Introduction 
1. This is ASP.Net Web API - also known as a backend service or a restful API. This API allows a user to access articles from different publishers.
2. It also allowers users to subscribe to newsletters from these publishing companies.

# Getting Started
1. While code first is a very excellent approach, I did not go with it considering there wasn't a lot of work to do - in creating a DB and its tables.
2. To kick start this project, please look into the project directory for a file naned 'SQLQuery1.sql'. Once located, you can either double click the file
   , which will in turn open the SQL Server Management studio, or either please open your SQL Server Management and open the file named above and copy the logic
   defined it. Execute the code on SQL Server Management studio once. This will create a Database with two tables named Articles and Subscriptions, it will also 
   insert default values to the Articles table. 
3. This project uses entity framework to handle the backend logic and whatever requests the server has to handle
4. To study further on the documentation of these API and the end points thereof, please run the project and click on th nav bar link named 'API'
